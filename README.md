## Memory-game
[>>>PLAY!😁](https://julietbrn.github.io/js-projects/random-game/)

Creating computer games is a separate area of programming that requires highly qualified developers. Computer games can be created by large companies, small teams, and even individual developers.

### Project Description
Memory-game is a set of pairs of identical cards, which are displayed face down. By clicking on a card, the player turns it over and clicks on the next card. If two cards show the same pictures, they remain open; if the pictures are different, the cards are turned face down. The goal of the game is to open all the cards in the least number of moves.
